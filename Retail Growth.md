**Author:** Chirayu Dudhade  
**Project Type:** Business Intelligence & Strategic Analysis  
**Dataset:** UCI Online Retail (UK-based gift retailer)  
**Period Covered:** Dec 2010 – Dec 2011  

---

**Objective:**  
Define a defensible execution path from an **$8.3M revenue baseline to a $9.6M target** using **operational efficiency and customer loyalty** — not aggressive acquisition.

---

## 📌 Executive Summary — The $9.6M Roadmap

This project analyzes transactional data from a **UK-based online gift retailer** to answer a single leadership question:

> **Is our success abroad truly scalable, or is it high-risk?**

Rather than reporting historical performance, this analysis functions as a **Growth Audit**.  
It identifies **where value is created**, **where it leaks**, and **where scaling is structurally safe**.

---

## 🧮 The Strategy Equation


**Current Revenue ($8.3M) + Recoverable Operational Leakage ($0.6M) + Conservative Loyalty-Led Growth ($0.7M) = $9.6M Execution Target**

This is not a forecasted upside or an acquisition-led bet. It is an execution-based scenario grounded in existing demand, retention behavior, and fixable inefficiencies.

---

## 🧠 Analytical Story Arc — The “Golden Thread”

The dashboard follows a four-page structure that mirrors executive decision-making:

**Diagnose → Attribute → Fix → Scale**

---

## Page 1 — Business Performance Pulse (The Health Check)

**Core Question:**  
Is our current success diversified and stable, or concentrated and fragile?

**Key Findings:**
- **Revenue concentration risk:** 51% of total revenue is generated by just **263 customers**
- **Category dependency:** Home Decor contributes over **35% of total revenue**
- **April anomaly:** A ~25% revenue drop in Q2 initially appears demand-driven

**Critical Insight:**  
Order volume remained stable during April. Revenue fell due to **fulfillment failure**, not customer disengagement — indicating **operational fragility**, not market weakness.

**Why This Matters:**  
Before scaling internationally, leadership must understand whether revenue strength is **structural or accidental**.

## Page 2 — Customer Insights & VIP Analysis (The “Whale” Strategy)

**Core Question:**  
Who is actually funding the business — and are they loyal?

**Key Findings:**
- Identified a **VIP tier (~top 5%)** with:
  - Average annual spend of **~$27K per customer**
  - Disproportionate contribution to total revenue
- **Netherlands** emerges as the most efficient international market:
  - ~70% repeat purchase rate
  - High Average Order Value (**~$2.8K**)

**Critical Insight:**  
Not all revenue is equal. Retained, high-frequency customers generate **compounding value** with lower risk than new acquisition.

## Page 3 — Operational Efficiency & Diagnostics (The Leaky Bucket)

**Core Question:**  
Where is revenue being lost before it ever hits the bank?

**Key Findings:**
- Identified **~$0.6M in recoverable revenue leakage** driven by cancellations
- Leakage is **concentrated, not systemic**:
  - Spain’s *Storage & Organization* category shows **~36% leakage**
- High order volume persists in affected months — confirming demand exists

**Critical Insight:**  
International growth is **not constrained by demand or marketing**.  
It is constrained by **operational ceilings** that silently erode revenue.

## Page 4 — Strategic Growth & Forecasting (The Path Forward)

**Core Question:**  
If we fix friction and protect loyalty, what does growth realistically look like?

**Key Findings:**
- Time-series forecasting shows:
  - **Upper-bound monthly revenue** stabilizing near **$900K**
  - Lower bound reflects inaction on operational issues
- A **30% retention stability threshold** is required for sustainable growth
- Home Decor and Kitchen & Dining show positive MoM momentum in high-efficiency markets

**Critical Insight:**  
Growth is achievable — **but only if operational leaks are sealed before scale is attempted**.

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation & Engineering

### 1. Semantic Layer & Category Mapping
- Engineered a **priority-based keyword mapping table** to classify unstructured product descriptions
- Applied consistent business logic across **540K+ transactions**
- Reduced “Other” category noise to statistically insignificant levels

**Why it matters:**  
Separates business logic from measures, improves auditability, and enables scalable category refinement without rewriting DAX.

---

### 2. Advanced DAX & Metrics
- **Net Revenue:** Adjusts for unit price variance and cancellations  
- **Leakage Index:** Quantifies gross-to-net erosion by country and category  
- **VIP LTV:** Lifetime value isolated to the top customer cohort  

All measures remain stable under heavy cross-filtering and page-level context.

## 📈 Strategic Recommendation Framework — Proceed, Pause, Plug

### ✅ PROCEED — Netherlands & Australia
- Scale immediately  
- High retention and strong AOV  
- Focus on **share-of-wallet**, not acquisition volume

### ⚠️ PAUSE — Spain & Japan
- Halt aggressive expansion  
- ~12% cancellation rate risks alienating high-value customers  
- Fix execution before scaling demand

### 🔧 PLUG — The $0.6M Revenue Leak
- Standardize international fulfillment for **Stationery & Storage**
- Equivalent to acquiring **~3,000 new customers at zero CAC**

## 🎯 Final Takeaway

This project moves beyond visualization into **decision support**.

By executing the **Proceed, Pause, Plug** framework, the business:
- Protects its most valuable customers  
- Removes structural friction  
- Converts existing demand into a **$9.6M revenue reality**

**This is growth driven by discipline, not optimism.**
